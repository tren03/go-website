chose to build the same project with vanilla js and then with a react framework later
for vanilla js decided to do server side rendering of the html pages
used clousure funcs to send data to handler funcs 

shifted to chi router to handle cors easier and have a http router to have better routing

supabase doesnt have official go docs, so going for third party libs (death)

supabase just gives a postgress uri, and we can use a native golang lib to access the data, peacful

so i downloaded different libs to check them out, but when i comment them in my project, run vendor and tidy, they are removed, package system is too good damn
