during development, i use docker-compose with volumes mounted and air in dockerfile to do hot reload, the .env path is given in docker-compose

during prod, i use a different dockerfile which generates binary and .env given at runtime, in railway, ill inject the env files directly



testing prod build locally
sudo docker build -t "artechles-test-image" .
sudo docker run --env-file .env -p 8080:8080 artechles-test-image


database fetch operation takes 320ms
lets see after go routines


in deployment we see that db fetch from go takes 1.77 seconds
fetch from js takes 2.139 seconds (includes the fetch time from go backend)
so i think go routines will help
